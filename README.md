# dotfiles

### Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/yangkev/.dotfiles $HOME/.dotfiles
$ cd $HOME/.dotfiles
$ ./install.sh
```

`install.sh` will go through all top level directories and ask to install that directory's dotfiles with `stow`. 
You can also choose to install individual directories with `stow vim` (for example) instead.

Uninstalling can be done with `./install.sh -u` or:
```
$ cd $HOME/.dotfiles
$ stow -D vim
...
```

For additional help, see:
```
$ ./install.sh -h
```
